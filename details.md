We are to be wed on the 20th November, 2021. If you lost the details card that was in your invitation, please [get in touch](mailto:rhysg3@gmail.com) with Rhys. 

### Dress Code
We would recommend semi-formal dress, but advise for at least somewhat sturdy footware- the ceremony will be taking place in a paddock with uneven terrain. The reception will be outside, and may get cold towards the end of the night.

<!-- ### Schedule
