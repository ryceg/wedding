  We are very fortunate to have been living together for several years. As a result, we already own a lot of the typical wedding registry gifts! We value your presence at our wedding above all else. However, if you want to give us something, but aren't sure what, we have a wedding registry, located below. We live simply, and enjoy wine, good food, experiences, and hand made items.

You can access the wedding registry in a new tab [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT7EemueUERelXd09C6mdrCLkIhLB9XjqE_ZXjeXyQPdnwqKem-qVYIPdM60Z87E5rtsKEjf4p3YBKM/pubhtml?gid=850058996&single=true).
