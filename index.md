  Welcome! Rather than print a long URL on the invitations, we figured we'd put all the need-to-know information here.

We are getting married. If you're on this site, we probably invited you. For the nitty-gritty, take a look at the [Details](https://rhysandclaire.me/details) of our special day.

If you are desperate to get us something other than your company, take a look at the [Registry](https://rhysandclaire.me/registry).

If you only know one of us, there's a brief overview of us in the [About](https://rhysandclaire.me/about).

This website will be updated with the pictures from the wedding after the fact.

Thank you so much for being a part of our lives- we cannot wait to celebrate with you :)
