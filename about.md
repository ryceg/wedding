We met at the Conservatorium of Music, where Rhys was two years ahead of Claire. There was an instant connection, and in a matter of a month, we were dating. The rest is history.

The first time Rhys met Claire's family, we accidentally dressed the same way!

## Engagement

Our engagement happened across three proposals. We had initially planned to have a gap year in Europe in 2020 before Claire's Honours year, but decided not to in late 2019. When it became clear (for obvious reasons) that 2020 was not the year for travel, Rhys suggested that we travel later "as a honeymoon" instead. Claire agreed, and in February 2020, Rhys proposed to Claire (officially) in the kitchen of our home with Claire's great-grandmother's ring. We both designed a new engagement ring together, and then Rhys presented it to Claire on kunanyi.
