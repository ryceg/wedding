We met at the Conservatorium of Music, where I was two years ahead of Claire. There was an instant connection, and in a matter of a month, we were dating. The rest is history.

The first time I met Claire's family, we accidentally dressed the same way!

## Engagement

Before Claire graduated in November 2019, we had a frank discussion of whether we were going to take a gap year before pursuing further study, to travel Europe. I suggested we do it "as a honeymoon". In February 2020, I proposed to Claire, and then in March, we decided that it was a jolly good thing that we didn't end up taking that gap year.
